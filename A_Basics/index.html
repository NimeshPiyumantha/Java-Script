    //single line comments

    /*  Multiline comments
    alert("Haai");
    alert("Haai");
    alert("Haai");
    alert("Haai");*/

    //Variables in JS

    /*
    ----In java-----
     String name="Dausn"; (type is strong, name can only be assigned string values)
     int age =20;
     boolean state= false;*/

    /* In JavaScript */
    /*How to make a variable in JS*/
    // var name="Hello JS";
    // typeof name; //string
    // alert(name);

    /* Why JS is known as Loosely typed language*/
    // var age=10; // in here no data type defined before creating the variable
    // So we can be assigned anything that we want for the age.
    // Because, JS is loosely typed language


    // So why JS in Dynamic Typing
    // var mySalary= 100000.99;
    // typeof  mySalary;//number // after assign value for the first time, I will get the type of that value

    // then after that can we change it.?
    // mySalary=true; // assigned another type of value to the previously created variable
    // typeof  mySalary; //boolean (now it is changed to boolean)

    //Let's change it again
    // mySalary="No Salary";
    // typeof  mySalary;//String (now it has changed to string) // always dynamically changing its data type

    // This is why js is known as dynamic scripting language


    /* So, what the troubles we have to face by creating variables using var declaration type */
    // var mySate=false;
    // var mySate=true; // can duplicate the identifiers

    // Does not satisfy the scope
    // var myTp=1199;
    {
        // console.log(myTp);// this is legal
        // var myAge=100;
    }
    // console.log(myAge);// this should be not accessible, but It is accessible


    // So what are the special features in var.?
    // Hoisting - you can use a variable which is going to be later initialized
    // console.log(x);//undefined
    // var x = 100;
    // console.log(x);//100


    /*What are the other ways that we have to create variables in JS*/
    let myName='Kasun'; // variables with let declaration
    console.log(myName);

    // So, What's new about let.?
    //let myName="Nimal"; // Error //Identifier 'myName' has already been declared


    // So, what about scope problem
    {
        console.log(myName);
        let myAge=10;
    }
    // console.log(myAge); // error // now this is not accessible


    let age=10;
    console.log(typeof  age);

    age=true;
    console.log(typeof  age);


    // what about hoisting?
    // console.log(x);// not working
    let x=100;

    // In let declaration we cannot duplicate identifiers
    // Scope is satisfied
    // Dynamic Typing Support
    // Not supporting for hoisting
